# TourGuideApp

Developed for the Udacity Android Nanodegree

This app shows some of the major sites of Princeton, NJ. You can click on one of the options (Restaurants, Hotels, Shopping, and Landmarks) in the main menu and get directed to a new page listing some popular locations within that category.
